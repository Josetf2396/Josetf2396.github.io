# Resume Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal resume website, hosted on **GitHub Pages**.  
The live site can be viewed here: [https://yourusername.github.io](https://yourusername.github.io)

## About
This is a static HTML/CSS website designed to showcase my professional background, skills, and experience in a simple, fast-loading format.  
The site is built without any frameworks or dependencies to ensure maximum compatibility and performance.

## How It Works
- **Hosting:** GitHub Pages automatically serves the content from the `main` branch.
- **Entry Point:** The `index.html` file is the homepage and contains the full resume.
- **Styling:** CSS is embedded in the HTML file for simplicity.
